-- Runs a set of commands for a given command table. If this is the first
-- command in the chain, it is given a FilePath and constructs a new, initially
-- blank, ScriptState. Otherwise, it is given the state as left by the previous
-- commandâ€™s execution.

-- The rest of the module should consist of similar functions, calling each
-- other so that each expression is parsed by a lower-level function and the
-- result can be used in a higher-level function. The Command table and state
-- are passed around as necessary to evaluate commands, assignments and
-- variable substitution. A better way to pass around variables would be to
-- use the State monad or even the StateT monad transformer to wrap IO into it.
